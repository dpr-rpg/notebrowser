record_type: Session
uri: Session-24
name: "Session 24"
tagline: "How about a little rice breaker to help everyone get comfortable?"
funfacts:
  ulrich: Ulrich has been carving his new staff.
  archibald: When Archibald went to University in Edinburgh, he fell in love with a lass named Elizabeth, who was a Presbyterian. Her strict father disapproved, and when Archibald went off to the Jacobite Rising, he left her behind. After the war, he sadly determined that he couldn't be with a Presbyterian and never sought her out.
  kywe: Kywe's younger brother was a troublemaker who would sneak out past curfew. One night, she saw him coming home late and wanted to protect him from their parent's anger. Suddenly, she saw a glowing hand in front of her and realized she could control it. She used it to break a plate in the other room to provide a distraction for him. (This was "Mage hand".)
  hildegard: Hildegard feels as though she's been holding back from the group. When she was younger, she was a rough-and-tumble kid who learned to fight and defend herself. As she got older, she converted this into a tendency to use her quick wits. Now she thinks she may need to be more forceful on this adventure.
  octavia: Octavia won't admit it out loud, but she misses Pangy a lot.

#### Morning, the barn behind the farmhouse

It is the day we are scheduled to meet the representative of {the-duke} in the town square of {farming-village}. {rice-farmer} comes into the room and warns us to stay hidden and not go outside.
He rushes back to the house.

{hildegard} sees that there's a loft in the barn.
She climbs up and peers through a gap in the barn wall.
She sees the town square in the distance.
There are soldiers moving around, quickly fanning out and forming a perimeter around the plaza.
They are moving quickly, professionally, quietly through the farmland, peering around in all directions.
In the plaza, there are two carriages.
One has livery: indigo with a gold circle in the middle.
Some figures pass between the carriages and part ways: one toward {red-cliffs}, one into the countryside.
The soldiers fall in behind the carriage heading away from {red-cliffs}.
After about 5 min, {rice-farmer} returns and says the coast is clear.

{kywe} asks the farmer why he told us to hide.
He says that it's good to keep your head down when the neighbors are out and about.
The Guards, like a small private army, work for the man who lives in the manor outside of town.
They aren't affiliated w/ any of the houses.
When they come into town, they're intimidating.

20 years ago, someone showed up and began building the manor outside of town on confiscated farmland.
It was House Tiger who supplied him with the space.
He does not farm the land. His business is unknown.
No one in the town works there. He brought some of his own staff.
The soldiers are all "like us" (i.e., Europeans).
This is why the townsfolk are resentful of Europeans.

The farmer feeds us breakfast and Yoyo gives him a gold piece.
He's somewhat taken aback.

We discuss the terrorist attack yesterday.
{ulrich} thinks {young-yang} was responsible.
{hildegard} thinks he had help, possibly from {the-duke}.

We head to the central plaza.
As the sun reaches its zenith, two huge oxen pulling a large carriage approach.
The carriage has the same livery (which is the same as the flag the woman at the beach was carrying!)
It has six wheels, each on a leaf spring, and it's riding smooth over the rutted path.

The driver pulls up, recognizes us, is clearly counting and surprised by the count.
We get inside, with Miggs riding shotgun.
It's lavish inside, with snacks and a decanter of brandy (which Archibald takes a swig from).

As we leave the farmland behind, we head down a manicured path.
There is a wall to the right [PICTURE]
We see some of the Guards patrolling along the road.
There is a gate, with 4 armed men on either side standing at attention.
They wave us through.
Octavia perceives that this is an imitation English garden.
Archibald sees that they have at least one pistol a piece and a long spear. They look attentive.
hildegard can tell that they're not tense.

The carriage continues along and pulls up to a large stone building with a decorative pool in front.
We get out and see a distinguished older man, who looks like a butler.
He recites our names (except Miggs).
When he gets to kywe, he gives her a long glance and says, "I'm afraid I don't know your family name."
She's cagey, but he welcomes her as part of the party.

He leads us in.
Inside the entryway, there are two guards.
They look like the same sort of guards as outside.
kywe looks around for other security features.
Everything seems fairly new and well-maintained.
There are European paintings.
It feels like England.
The plants are mostly native to burma, but the plantings are approximating England.

octavia investigates the artwork.
There's just too much art and sculpture for the space.
Archibald whispers to Hildegard that this looks like it was stolen/looted and brought here.

Kywe uses _Detect Magic_ to determine that there are sources of magic here other than what we brought with us.

There is a closed door and Octavia uses her _Mirror_ to see what's on the other side: it's a ballroom.
She sees the Duke enter the ballroom.
He opens the door and greets us with flattery.
He knows some info about each of us.

He mentions that there are other guests at the manor.
According to Archibald's sense of Good and Evil, he detects that the Duke has loyalty to the established powers in the area.
Archibald flourishes his intimidating cloak and demands to know who the other guests are.
The Duke begins to tell us about a distinguished gentleman from Wales.
Ulrich interrupts that in our world there are no such things.
The Duke responds that we have a lot to talk about.

He tells us that he'd like to find a way to smooth over any misunderstandings between us and the Captain (who is presumably here).
He also tells us about a businessman from Red Cliffs.
He considers himself a patron of those displaced by the misfortunes of his home country.
This is a place of peace and homelike.
And a place to make plans to make right the wrongs that have been done there.

He tells us that his butler, Stephens, will show us our rooms.
The guards will tell us where we can go and where we can not.

Tonight at 5 o'clock, he will host us for dinner.
He asks Hildegard to perform after dinner and she agrees.
He tells us we can explore outside or relax in our rooms.
It's about 1:30pm.

The manor is on the scale and lavishness of Downton Abbey.
We each get a small room along a hallway on the East side of the building.
They are all next to each other.
The hall has windows opening onto a courtyard.
(Miggs gets put in the servants' quarters.)

For next time:

- Kywe and Ulrich will search out a spa/bath area to relax.
- The other four will snoop around the manor. Octavia and {yoyo} want to look into/scope out the forbidden areas. Hildegard and Archibald will chat up/distract the guards. (Archibald's looking for Scots or other who might be trying to undermine the scheming here.)

As we're planning, we hear a large splash outside.
