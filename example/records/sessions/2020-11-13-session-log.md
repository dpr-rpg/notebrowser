#### Fleeing {red-cliffs}

As we are rushing through the crowd, {octavia}, who had been in the bathroom asks what happened. We explain that someone had fed lots of magic mushrooms to the elephants, which went crazy and attacked. {the-anchor} and his family except for {young-yang}, who is now in charge.

[Clarification: the scaffolds collapsed in front of House Dog, Snake, and Tiger.]

Once we're down among the ordinary folks, it's clear that our fancy clothes stick out and we're drawing some glances.
Ulrich hears someone say, "That's him! Ulrich the monster hunter." And others reply that he's wanted.
He throws them a wink.
They seem a little scared and start tailing us.
Kywe hears some people at a distance recognizing Hildegard as the musician from last night.

Archibald is out in front with his intimidating cloak trying to clear a path.
Hildegard is wondering how fast she can change her clothing and hair to go unnoticed.

Yoyo is looking around for where the fancy people have gone.
They appear to have hunkered down in place.

[Clarification: In the outskirts of town, there is a small village center. The Duke gave us directions to a statue in the village square.
His driver will meet us there in two days time.]

We decide to leave ASAP. (Archibald suggested sheltering in the Aztec embassy, but the others didn't bite.)

Ulrich uses [WHAT] to conceal us in plain sight as we move through the crowd.
Archibald saves Hildegard from some awkward stumbling by putting her hat back on her head to show the folks unsettled by him that they're together.

#### Late afternoon

The group has made it out of the crowds, dusty and sweaty.
Anxiety permeates the city.
We step into a red stone plaza. There is a sculpture in the middle of the plaza.
It is a person standing tall and holding up what looks like a sword.
It's a stylized, intense warrior pose.
We are outside the hustle and bustle.
This is where the Duke's emissary.

We start looking for shelter.
Kywe suggests looking for a host family, but doesn't know anyone here.
It's {farming-village}.
Yoyo decides to barter some minor smithing for lodging in a hayloft, etc.

Archibald goes up to the first farmer he sees.
{rice-farmer} is packing up a cart with empty sacks.
Climbing around on the cart is a small ape.
There is what looks like a very large muscular ox pulling the empty cart.
The farmer is in his mid-forties.
Scattered all over the ground is rice.

Archibald draws his rapier and starts miming sharpening, points at the farmer, points at Yoyo, picks up some stray rice stems, tosses them, slices them with his rapier in midair, points again at Yoyo, then the farmer, then sheathes the rapier.
The farmer is convinced and takes them back to the farm.

At the farm, there's hustle and bustle as the kids run around setting up a place for us to stay and a meal.
The meal is humble but good.
Archibald and Yoyo go with the farmer to see the tools.

There are five to seven children around, as well as the farmer's wife.
After the mean, the wife shuffles the kids up to bed.
Kywe, Octavia, Ulrich, and Hildegard are left behind.
Hildegard gets out her lute to teach the children.

With the children entertained, the wife asks Kywe why we're here.
She's younger than her husband (mid-30s) with seven kids.
Kywe explains that she recently joined this group and that we're adventurers who travel around killing monsters.
She asks what brought us here and whether we work for House Tiger.
She has heard rumours about what happened.
Kywe tells her what happened and that we were there for it.
(The children are terrified and she sends them to bed.)
She tells Kywe that if this is true, there's going to be a lot of turmoil.

##### Yoyo, Archibald, and the Farmer

It turns out that the Farmer speaks a bit of Chinese and can chat with Yoyo.
He brings out a bunch of tools, barrels, wagons to work on.
Yoyo starts to work.
He gives critical opinions on the tools, even when unsolicited.

The farmer sees that Yoyo is doing a good job and asks whether he would be willing to sharpen some tools for his neighbor as well.
Archibald goes with him and he asks A to hide his face.
They return uneventfully.

Yoyo asks the farmer about his income.
Archibald is skeptical about the question.
He says that he makes about twice what other farmers do.
Part is that he keeps an orderly farm.
Part is keeping your head down and not asking too many questions of the neighbors.
He admits that they do get their fair share of visitors coming through the plaza (meaning Europeans), they don't stick around, they appear to be visiting the Duke.
There are some off-limits areas.
Yoyo asks where the place is. It's a manor outside the city. He has his own private guards.

Archibald is worried about this line of conversation, so he changes the subject.
He offers some gold for having the farmer's sons deliver a message to the Aztec Embassy.
The farmer agrees.

Ulrich keeps copying down the notes from Twiggy's place.

##### Back at the farmhouse

Octavia wants to know what our plan is.
She's unsure why exactly we want to see the Duke.
Hildegard agrees that we need to have a serious game plan.

Archibald wants consensus about whether we want to go back.
He thinks it's pretty good.
Yoyo wants to stay and explore more magic.
Hildegard's ultimate goal is to go between the worlds easily.
A darkness settles over Octavia's face as she remembers her original goal: to heal her sick aunt. She's been so caught in our adventures, she lost sight of that.
Kywe feels a sense of loyalty to the Anchor and is worried that the Duke may have been responsible for killing him.

Archibald describes his experience with the Aztecs and his political ambitions here to assist the Aztecs and help them loosen the Customs Guild's hold on magic.
Yoyo thinks it's a good idea to make the use of magic less restricted since we're classified as illegal uses.
He wants to take whatever job the Duke offers as long as it's not against our interests.

##### Flashback to Archibald in the embassy

The room where Archibald met the spymaster, the walls were lined with vassals' crests.
Some of them had Christian iconography.
Co-planar with the Aztec sun icon, are the arms of the Kingdom of Spain. It has been split with three crosses, and a smaller version of the Aztec icon in one of the quarters.
(Some kind of grafting happened.)

We retire for the evening and level up.

#### The next morning

Ulrich studies his book, _Magic: The Gathering of Sources_.
He was looking for info on necromantic mushrooms.
He finds a drawing of a familiar mushroom with light emanating from it.
He finds a series of legends, collected folklore, from S Asia, E Asia, and C Asia.
He sees a legend of the [WHAT], reanimated corpses who move in a hopping way, killing living creatures, and draining their life force.
[SETH FILL IN THE REST OF THE FOLKLORE.]
The writer notes conspicuous similarities among the far-flung stories.
The creatures never reproduce, they just pop up somewhere.
The stories seem to have spread from somewhere in southeast Asia.
The creatures tend to live in caves, in the dark, underground.
Someone claims to have found mushrooms growing in a cave where some of the creatures were found in Romania.
[SOMETHING ABOUT THE NUMBER 3]

As we wake up, the farmer rushes into the room and tells us to be quiet, we need to hide.
